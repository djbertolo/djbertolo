I'm currently a fourth-year senior at California State University, San Bernardino double-majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a minor in Data Science. My goal is to pursue graduate studies (M.S./Ph.D.) to research about vulnerabilities in modern distributed systems.

###  About Me

My fascination with technology lies at the intersection of software development and cybersecurity. While my **CompTIA Security+** certification provides a strong foundation in traditional security, I'm driven to explore the evolving landscape of cloud security, as validated by my **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification.

- 🎓 I'm a final-year B.S. in Computer Science and Computer Engineering student.
- ☁️ My core interest is **Cloud-Native Application Security**, specifically within serverless architectures.
- 🔒 I'm currently building my expertise in **Go (Golang)** for its performance and concurrency in cloud environments. You can check out how I'm developing my Go skills [here](https://github.com/djbertolo/learning-go)!
- 📄 My ultimate goal is to contribute to the academic field of cybersecurity through focused research.

### 🔭 My Current Research Project

In order to better understand vulnerabilities where it concerns commonly used Cloud-based services, I am exploring serverless services such as AWS Lambda and the vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of if applications are not properly configured or secured.

* **Project:** **[A Practical Investigation of Event Data Injection Vulnerabilities in Go-based AWS Lambda Functions](https://github.com/your-username/go-lambda-security-research)**
* **Description:** I'm developing a reproducible testbed using **Go**, **AWS Lambda**, and **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)** to practically demonstrate, analyze, and document security vulnerabilities in a serverless environment. This hands-on approach allows me to explore the real-world impact of insecure coding patterns in the cloud.
