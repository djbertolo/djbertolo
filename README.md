### About Me

My fascination with technology lies at the intersection of computer architecture and software security. I'm passionate about understanding how systems work at a low level to discover and analyze security vulnerabilities. My academic background in both computer science and engineering provides the ideal foundation for exploring the complex interactions between hardware and software.

- 🎓 I'm a final-year B.S. in **Computer Science** and **Computer Engineering** student.
- 🔬 My core interest is **Vulnerability Research**, including reverse engineering, binary analysis, and exploit development.
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/C_Programming_Language.svg/1200px-C_Programming_Language.svg.png" width=15> I'm currently strengthening my fundamentals in **C** and **systems programming** to build a solid base for low-level security analysis. You can track my progress [here](https://github.com/djbertolo/learning-c)!
- 📄 My ultimate goal is to contribute to the academic field of cybersecurity through research in automated vulnerability discovery and exploit mitigation.

### 🔭 My Current Research Project: Dep-Trust

I am currently developing **Dep-Trust**, a novel static analysis tool designed to address the critical issue of **software supply chain security**. Inspired by widespread vulnerabilities like Log4j, this project aims to help developers and researchers detect malicious code injected into open-source dependencies.

Written in **C**, Dep-Trust recursively parses a project's build files to construct a complete dependency graph. The core innovation lies in its **anomaly-based heuristic engine**. Instead of relying on known malware signatures, Dep-Trust flags suspicious libraries by identifying behaviors that deviate from their stated purpose. It detects capability mismatches (e.g., a math library making network calls), analyzes code entropy to find obfuscated payloads, and uncovers other anomalous patterns that traditional tools often miss.

The goal is to create a practical tool that provides a deeper, more context-aware layer of security for the software ecosystem. You can follow the project's development [here](https://github.com/djbertolo/dep-trust)!
