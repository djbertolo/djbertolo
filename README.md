I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at California State University, San Bernardino, double-majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a minor in Data Science. My goal is to pursue graduate studies (M.S./Ph.D.) focused on **systems security** and **vulnerability research**.

### About Me

My fascination with technology lies at the intersection of computer architecture and software security. I'm passionate about understanding how systems work at a low level to discover and analyze security vulnerabilities. My academic background in both computer science and engineering provides the ideal foundation for exploring the complex interactions between hardware and software.

- 🎓 I'm a final-year B.S. in **Computer Science** and **Computer Engineering** student.
- 🔬 My core interest is **Vulnerability Research**, including reverse engineering, binary analysis, and exploit development.
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/C_Programming_Language.svg/1200px-C_Programming_Language.svg.png" width=15> I'm currently strengthening my fundamentals in **C** and **systems programming** to build a solid base for low-level security analysis. You can track my progress [here](https://github.com/djbertolo/learning-c)!
- 📄 My ultimate goal is to contribute to the academic field of cybersecurity through research in automated vulnerability discovery and exploit mitigation.

### 🔭 My Current Research Project: Dep-Trust

I am currently developing **Dep-Trust**, a novel static analysis tool designed to address software supply chain security. This project serves as the foundation for my graduate research interests in automated vulnerability discovery.

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/djbertolo/dep-trust)

#### Key Features & Methodology
- **Recursive Dependency Graphing:** Written in C, the tool recursively parses build files (e.g., Makefiles, `go.mod`) to construct a complete, directed graph of all project dependencies.
- **Anomaly-Based Heuristic Engine:** Instead of relying on signatures, the engine flags suspicious libraries by detecting capability mismatches (e.g., a string-formatting library making network calls) and analyzing code entropy for signs of obfuscation.
- **Behavioral Fingerprinting:** Each dependency is profiled to create a "normal behavior" baseline, against which future versions can be compared to detect trojan-horse updates.

#### Current Status & Next Steps
- **In Progress:** Implementing a robust Makefile parser to handle complex C/C++ projects.
- **Up Next:** Developing the initial heuristic engine to identify anomalous system call patterns in dependency code.
