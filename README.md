### About Me

My fascination with technology lies at the intersection of computer architecture and software security. I'm passionate about understanding how systems work at a low level to discover and analyze security vulnerabilities. My academic background in both computer science and engineering provides the ideal foundation for exploring the complex interactions between hardware and software.

- 🎓 I'm a final-year B.S. in **Computer Science** and **Computer Engineering** student.
- 🔬 My core interest is **Vulnerability Research**, including reverse engineering, binary analysis, and exploit development.
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/C_Programming_Language.svg/1200px-C_Programming_Language.svg.png" width=15> I'm currently strengthening my fundamentals in **C** and **systems programming** to build a solid base for low-level security analysis. You can track my progress [here](https://github.com/djbertolo/learning-c)!
- 📄 My ultimate goal is to contribute to the academic field of cybersecurity through research in automated vulnerability discovery and exploit mitigation.
