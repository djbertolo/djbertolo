I'm a Computer Science student at California State University, San Bernardino, with a minor in Data Science. My primary academic interests are in **programming languages**, **type systems**, and **static analysis**. I have an interest in understanding how language design, type theory, and mathematical structure can be used to reason about programs and make software safer.

While I enjoy security, my long-term goal is to approach it through the lens of programming languages utilizing concepts such as static analysis, type systems, and formal methods to prevent vulnerabilities before they exist.

## Current Research: *MiniLua* - Static Type Inference for a Lua-like Language

I am developing **MiniLua**, a research project investigating static type inference for a simplified Lua-like scripting language.

The project explores:
- Designing a small language with simplified Lua semantics
- Implementing a lexer, recursive-descent parser, and AST
- Building a constraint-based type inference system
- Implementing a Hindley-Milner-style unification engine
- Detecting type errors, invalid operations, and inconsistent returns

This work is giving me hands-on experience with type systems, constraint solving, language semantics, and the challenges of analyzing dynamic-language features.

## Academic Direction & Interests

### Programming Languages & Type Systems
- Type Inference (Hindley-Milner)
- Constraint Generation
- Semantics & program structure
- Language and compiler design

### Static Analysis
- Control-flow reasoning
- Type error detection
- Abstract representation of dynamic features
- Building sound models of program behavior

### Security

I am especially interested in using programming language techniques to solve security problems:
- Static detection of vulnerabilities
- Type-based memory safety
- Safer language and compiler design
- Formal reasoning to eliminate classes of bugs

My goal is to work at the intersection of programming languages and security research.

## Coursework

For the Fall 2025 semester, my aim with my class selection was to explore the engineering side of the Computer Science and Engineering department at my university. I wished to expand the breadth of my knowledge past my Computer Science coursework. As it was iconically said in *Oppenheimer (2023)*, theory will only take you so far. In my coursework, I have gotten to work directly with embedded devices, various sensors and have created numerous block diagrams.

Here is the list of my Fall 2025 coursework:
- Robotics and Control with Dr. Haiyan Qiao
- Computer Engineering Design with Dr. Yunfei Hou
- Contemporary Computer Architecture with Dr. Nazanin Ghasemian
- Parallel Algorithms & Programming with Dr. Ahmad Abu Shanab

For the Spring 2026 semester, my aim with my class selection is to reinforce my mathematics foundations, and expand on areas of interest. I aim to expand my computer systems knowledge with coursework in Operating Systems, while studying fundamentals to mathematical theory.

Here is the list of my Spring 2026 coursework:
- Multivariable Calculus
- Mathematical Thinking: Communication and Proofs
- Advanced Operating Systems

## Books I'm Reading

Recently I have finished reading *The C Programming Language, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, as well as *Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming* by Jon Bodner. I have recently begun reading *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom, and plan to begin *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.
